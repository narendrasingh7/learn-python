## Python Install

Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.

To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):

**C:\Users\ *Your Name* >python --version**

To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac,

**python --version**


If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

## Python Quickstart

Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.

For linux:- run commands

$	touch helloworld.py 	# creating file
$	nano helloworld.py 		# going into nano editor to edit

Then write this line into the file >>

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the changes by ctrl + X and press Yes.

That's it , You Have written your firt python program.

The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
**$ 	python helloworld.py	#running python file**

if not work please try with this if you have installed python3:
**$	python3 helloworld.py**

After this you will see output like this in the terminal.

Hello, World!

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.



## The Python Command Line

To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.



Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:

C:\Users\ *Your Name* >python or python3

Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":C:\Users\ *Your Name* >py

From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:

print("Hello, World!")

Hello, World!

Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:

exit()
