You’ll learn about the basic Python syntax so that you can get started with the Python language quickly.

## What is Syntax?

Syntax in programming refers to the specific rules and conventions that dictate how code should be written in a particular programming language. It encompasses things like keywords, punctuation, and structure, ensuring that code is formatted correctly for the computer to understand and execute.

You need to follow the syntax otherwise you will get error and not able to execute the program. This is very important thing for any programming langauge.

## Python Indentation & Whitespace

If you’ve been working in other programming languages such as Java, C#, or C/C++, you know that these languages use semicolons (`;`) to separate the statements.

However, Python uses whitespace and indentation to construct the code structure.

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, **The most common use is four (4).**

Recommend: always use 4 spaces.
